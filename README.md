# Nearby House Prices Web App

Returns average house prices based on your current location. Data is taken from the [related API](https://github.com/mdowds/nearby-house-prices-api), which in turn gets its data from the [Land Registry](http://landregistry.data.gov.uk/).

A live version of the app can be found at <https://mdowds.github.io/nearby-house-prices-app/>

The app itself will run with no dependencies, but the unit tests require the NPM modules given in package.json
